# 100 Days of DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

Welcome to my **100 Days of DSA** repository! In this repository, I will be uploading the solutions to daily practice coding problems from various topics in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

The goal of this repository is to practice solving problems and improve my problem-solving skills in preparation for coding interviews and competitions.

## ðŸ“… Daily Coding Challenges

I will be solving three problem every day for **100 days**, covering a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more.

Each problem will be solved using the best possible approach, and solutions will be uploaded in the respective folder for each topic.

## ðŸ’» Problem Solving Topics

The problems will be categorized into the following topics:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees and Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **String Algorithms**
