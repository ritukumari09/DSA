/*Given an array a[] of n positive integers which can contain inteegers from 1 to n where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count frequency of all elements from 1 to n.
Note: Excepted time complexity is O(n) with O(1) extra space.
Input: 5

Output:

/*To solve this problem in O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space, we can use the input array itself to store the frequencies by modifying the elements. Here's the approach:

Algorithm:
Adjust values to fit array indices: Since the values are between 1 and n, we can use the array indices as markers.

Frequency encoding:
For each element in the array, use the formula 
index=elementâˆ’1 to map the element to its corresponding index.
Increase the value at this index by n. This marks how many times the element has been seen.

Decode the frequencies:
Traverse the array again, dividing each element by n to get the count of each number.

Output the frequencies:
Iterate from 1 to n and print the frequency of each number.
